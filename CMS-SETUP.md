## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

1. A Supabase account (sign up at https://supabase.com)
2. Node.js and npm installed
3. Your existing portfolio project

## ðŸ”§ Setup Steps

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com and create a new project
2. Choose a name for your project (e.g., "portfolio-cms")
3. Set a secure database password
4. Wait for the project to be created

### 2. Set up Database Schema

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to "SQL Editor" in the sidebar
3. Copy the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` file
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor and run it
5. This will create all necessary tables and security policies

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. In your Supabase project, go to Settings > API
2. Copy your project URL and anon public key
3. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### 4. Set up Supabase Storage

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to "Storage"
2. Create a new bucket called "images"
3. Make it public by going to bucket settings and enabling "Public bucket"
4. Set up the following RLS policies for the images bucket:

```sql
-- Allow public read access to images
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'images');

-- Allow authenticated admin users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Admin upload access" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'images' AND 
  auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true)
);

-- Allow authenticated admin users to delete
CREATE POLICY "Admin delete access" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'images' AND 
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true)
);
```

### 5. Create Admin User

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to "Authentication" > "Users"
2. Click "Add user" and create an admin account with your email
3. After creating the user, go to "SQL Editor" and run:

```sql
-- Replace 'your-admin-email@example.com' with your actual email
UPDATE profiles 
SET is_admin = true 
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```
