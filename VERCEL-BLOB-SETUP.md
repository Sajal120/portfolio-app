# Vercel Blob Storage Integration Guide

## Overview

Your portfolio admin interface now uses **Vercel Blob Storage** for all image uploads instead of Supabase Storage. This provides better integration with Vercel deployment and potentially better performance.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Vercel Blob Store

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to the **Storage** tab
3. Click **Create Database** and select **Blob**
4. Choose a name for your blob store (e.g., "portfolio-images")
5. Select your preferred region
6. Click **Create**

### 2. Get Your Blob Token

1. In your Vercel dashboard, go to your newly created Blob store
2. Click on the **Settings** tab
3. Find the **API Tokens** section
4. Copy the **BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN**

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with your Vercel Blob token:

```env
# Vercel Blob Storage Configuration
VITE_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_1234567890abcdef...
```

**Important**: 
- The environment variable must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the browser
- Make sure to also add this environment variable to your Vercel deployment:
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add `VITE_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` with your token value

### 4. Deploy Changes

Deploy your changes to Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
# Push to your Git repository to trigger Vercel deployment
```

## What Changed

### Components Updated

1. **AdminMedia** - Media library management with Vercel Blob
2. **AdminHero** - Hero background image uploads
3. **AdminProjects** - Project image uploads  
4. **AdminAbout** - Profile image uploads

### New Features

- **Automatic file organization**: Files are organized in folders by type:
  - `images/` - General images
  - `hero/` - Hero background images
  - `projects/` - Project images
  - `about/` - Profile images
  - `videos/` - Video files
  - `documents/` - PDF and document files
  - `misc/` - Other file types

- **Enhanced validation**:
  - File type validation
  - File size limits (10MB for images, 5MB for profile images)
  - Better error handling

- **Improved performance**:
  - Direct CDN delivery
  - Better caching
  - Global edge distribution

### File Management

The media library now supports:
- ✅ Upload multiple files at once
- ✅ Automatic file type detection and organization
- ✅ Copy public URLs to clipboard
- ✅ Download files
- ✅ Delete individual or multiple files
- ✅ Search and filter capabilities
- ✅ File size and upload date display

## Development vs Production

### Local Development
During local development, Vercel Blob API calls are blocked by CORS policies since they need to run on the server. The integration includes a **development mode** that:
- ✅ Simulates file uploads, listing, and deletion using localStorage
- ✅ Provides realistic testing of the UI and functionality
- ✅ Allows you to test the complete workflow locally
- ✅ Shows mock file URLs that look like real Vercel Blob URLs

### Production (Vercel Deployment)
When deployed to Vercel, the integration will:
- ✅ Use real Vercel Blob storage
- ✅ Store files in your actual blob store
- ✅ Provide real CDN URLs for global delivery
- ✅ Handle all operations server-side without CORS issues

### Testing Locally
1. **Mock Mode**: All operations use localStorage simulation
2. **Real URLs**: Mock URLs follow the pattern `https://mock-blob-storage.vercel-storage.com/`
3. **Full Functionality**: Upload, list, delete all work as expected
4. **Console Logs**: Detailed logging shows what's happening behind the scenes

## Benefits of Vercel Blob Storage

1. **Seamless Integration**: Works perfectly with Vercel deployment
2. **Global CDN**: Fast delivery worldwide via Vercel's edge network
3. **Scalability**: Automatic scaling without configuration
4. **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use
5. **Security**: Built-in security with token-based authentication
6. **Performance**: Optimized for web delivery

## File Organization Structure

```
blob-store/
├── images/           # General images
├── hero/            # Hero background images
├── projects/        # Project images
├── about/           # Profile images
├── videos/          # Video files
├── documents/       # PDF and documents
└── misc/            # Other file types
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"VITE_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN not found"**
   - Ensure the token is properly set in your `.env` file with the `VITE_` prefix
   - Check that the token is added to Vercel environment variables
   - Restart your development server after adding the token

2. **CORS errors in development**
   - This is expected! Vercel Blob API calls are blocked by CORS in browsers
   - The integration automatically uses mock mode for local development
   - Real blob operations will work when deployed to Vercel

3. **Upload failures**
   - In development: Check browser localStorage for mock files
   - In production: Check file size limits and network connectivity
   - Verify file type is supported (images, videos, PDFs, documents)

### File Size Limits

- **Profile images**: 5MB maximum
- **Project/Hero images**: 10MB maximum
- **Other files**: 10MB maximum

### Supported File Types

- **Images**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG
- **Videos**: MP4, WebM
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT

## Migration Notes

- **Existing files**: If you had files in Supabase Storage, you'll need to re-upload them through the admin interface
- **URLs**: File URLs will change from Supabase URLs to Vercel Blob URLs
- **Database**: Your Supabase database remains unchanged - only file storage has moved

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Vercel Blob store is properly configured
4. Check that file types and sizes meet the requirements

## Security

- All uploads require admin authentication through your existing Supabase auth system
- Files are stored securely in Vercel Blob storage
- Public URLs are generated for web display but require proper token for uploads/deletions
- File validation prevents malicious uploads

Your portfolio now has a robust, scalable image management system powered by Vercel Blob Storage!
